                politician who is the Chief Adviser of Bangladesh since 2024. He was a professor of economics and is
                famous for his work in microcredit. Microcredit is a name for giving small loans. These loans are given
                to people with very little money.Most banks do not give microcredit. Yunus started the Grameen Bank. In
                2006, Yunus and the bank together, were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, "for their efforts to create
                economic and social development from below."[1] Yunus himself has received several other national and
                international awards.</p>
